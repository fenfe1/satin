# This is an Ansible inventory file. It inherits from /etc/ansible/hosts if it exists
# It organises hosts/nodes into logical groups which can then be used in playbooks

# This inventory is for the 'production' environment

# It is best practice is group hosts by location and purpose like so:

[calcifer-digital-ocean]
calcifer-satin-prod-node1.calcifer.co

[nodes:children]
calcifer-digital-ocean

[all-servers:children]
nodes
